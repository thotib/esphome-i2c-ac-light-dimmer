Krida Electronics 4CH I2C AC Light Dimmer join with ESPHome 
This light dimmer controller is connected via I2C line to an esp8266 board, for example Wemos D1 or D1R2 mini, etc. The ESP board connects to Home Assistant home automation system, across ESPHome integration.
I use such a light controller in my Home Assistant and it works great.
Lighting controller is a smart device. You need to specify what brightness to set (between 0-100) and you're done.
